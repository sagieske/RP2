WEEK 1:
			Gather literature
			Write project proposal

WEEK 2:
09-06:		Pinksteren
10-06:		Download Dresden Image Database
			Figure out quantization table extraction
11-06:		Meeting at NFI
13-06:		Finally found method for quantization table extraction for batch!!
14-06:		Write scripts for quantization table extraction JPEG SNOOP

WEEK 3:
16-06: 		Rewrite scripts to use DJPEG, Start writing on chapters (methods)
17-06:		Modify previous scripts, Create feature extraction scripts. Run scripts. TODO! SPACE IS FULL ON SERVER :(
			Figuring out the input for sklearn decisiontreeclassifier
			Finished extraction dqt tables with script
20-06:		Incorporate decision tree learning. Works but some problems with few files
21-06:		Debug extraction of quantization table. Debug decision tree learning
22-06:		Create executables. Incorporate statistics
23-06:		Work at location NFI. Modify scripts to use external hard drive, goddamn spaces and brackets! still does not work
24-06:		Rewrite files without spaces and brackets. Extraction quantization tables from external hard drive done.
